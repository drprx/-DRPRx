DRPRx is the solution to the broken healthcare system of today. Currently the patient is 
not at the center of their own health data. Patients have very little control and almost 
no access to their OWN health information. DRPRx will put the patient in charge of his/her health care; allowing the patient to choose who is allowed access to their health records. Patients, providers and insurance companies will benefit from the easy to use app and web based interface that DRPRx provides.

DRPRx uses the guldFS file system, which will ensure security and privacy to the highest degree. To date no other patient centered medical record company offers both secure encryption and decentralization of medical information. An engaging service geared towards medical care and protection of digital identity.
